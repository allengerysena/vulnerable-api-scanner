# vulnerable-api-scanner
This script is a scanner for vulnerable APIs from the repository https://github.com/michealkeines/Vulnerable-API and is used for educational purposes only. From the list of APIs, I created a Postman Collection and automated the scanning process. The output includes a feature to send the results to a specific email, but SMTP configuration is required first.
